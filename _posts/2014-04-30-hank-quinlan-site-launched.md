These pages were made following a [tutorial by Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).<br> Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts.<br>"It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be," was in the original example blog post, but it's true! It actually *was* a lot easier than I had thought.
