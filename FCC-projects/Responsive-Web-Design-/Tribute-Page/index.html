            <p>Norman Borlang grew up on a his family's farm. His grandfather encouraged him to further his education. While working in the Civilian Conservation Corps to pay for his education, he saw many starving people and this left its mark on him. He wound up studying plant pathology.</p>
            <p>After sevrving as a wartime scientist at DuPont, he went to Mexico to join The Cooperative Wheat Research Production Program. There, he conducted a lot of research on producing more wheat, through such techniques as doubling the harvest season, increasing disease resistance, and dwarfing, which is breeding the wheat to have shotter and thicker stalks which could support extra grain.</p>
            <p>From there, he exported his reaserch to South Asia, where there was minor famine and starvation. Despite many obstacles, his work eventually aided Palistan and India to each be self sufficient in gran production.
